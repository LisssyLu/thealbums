 Hello. My name is Lissy, also known as LÃœ. 
Ive always had a passion for album package design, 
more so geared towards korean packaging within the kpop industry. 
Some people may ask, why does packaging matter? 
Well...if your'e a designer, it matters a lot, at least... it always has for me. 
One of the biggest goals in our lives is to make money, so we can survive and live in this world. 
In order to do that, we get jobs- as designers. 
A designer, in order to make money, needs to put things out into the world that will attract that money. 
Customers are the source. 
If we can't connect to customers in an efficient way, we will not be making any profit. 
In order to survive realistically, we need to connect to others and bring funcitonality, emotion, care, and attention 
to customers. 
In this way, we can begin to understand the basic foundation of why packaging for products is important.

Think of your favorite packaging. Think why you like the packaging. Most of your answers will lead you back to who made the packaging and designs of said packaging. 
If I went to Target and bought a Stray Kids album, I would buy the album because it is visually appealing and it comes with other items in the package. 
If I bought an ENHYPEN album, I would buy it because of the sealed purfume card that comes on the inside and the stickers that come with it too.

These parts of one single album package is conceptual, analytical, visual, and marketable aspects that we see in the majority of south korea's album packaging industry.
You might be wondering who comes up with these ideas? 
And the answer is...designers. 
Are you suprised? 
Most of society pushes designers to the side, but...everyone is enough right?
